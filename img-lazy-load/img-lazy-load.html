<p>A typical distributed system consists of many services collaborating together.

These services are prone to failure or delayed responses. If a service fails it may impact on other services affecting performance and possibly making other parts of application inaccessible or in the worst case bring down the whole application.

Of course, there are solutions available that help make applications resilient and fault tolerant – one such framework is Hystrix.

The Hystrix framework library helps to control the interaction between services by providing fault tolerance and latency tolerance. It improves overall resilience of the system by isolating the failing services and stopping the cascading effect of failures.

In this series of posts we will begin by looking at how Hystrix comes to the rescue when a service or system fails and what Hystrix can accomplish in these circumstances.
